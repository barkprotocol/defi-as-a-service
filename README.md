# BARK Protocol - Blockchain As A Service (BaaS) Platform
**Proof of Concept**

## Overview

BARK empowers users and developers to create fast and efficient Solana actions, blinks, and decentralized applications, enhancing blockchain development through our all-in-one platform.

## Getting Started

To set up the BARK Protocol project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barkprotocol/blockchain-as-a-service.git
   cd blockchain-as-a-service
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=your_solana_rpc_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILCHIMP_URL=your_mailchimp_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_mailchimp_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BLINK_PLATFORM_API_KEY=your_blink_platform_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **Open** `http://localhost:3000` **in your browser to see the application.**

## How it Works

BARK Blink leverages the power of the Solana blockchain and the Blink Platform to provide fast, efficient, and scalable decentralized services. Here's an in-depth overview of how the main features work:

1. **Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)**:
   - Utilizes a BaaS model to abstract complex blockchain operations.
   - Provides pre-optimized smart contracts and APIs for common blockchain tasks, reducing development time.

2. **Wallet Connection**:
   - Connects Solana wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) and manages status globally using Redux.

3. **Token Swaps**:
   - Interfaces with multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to find the best rates and optimizes the swap path.

4. **Staking**:
   - Allows users to stake BARK tokens, with dynamic APY based on network participation.

5. **Crowdfunding**:
   - Handles campaign creation and fund distribution through smart contracts.

6. **NFT Gallery**:
   - Fetches and displays NFTs owned by the connected wallet, with integrated marketplace features.

7. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Processes all transactions on the Solana blockchain, monitoring status in real-time.

8. **State Management**:
   - Combines React's state management with Redux for complex global state.

9. **Styling and Theming**:
   - Built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a responsive and customizable UI.

10. **Internationalization**:
    - Uses react-intl for managing translations and formatting.
